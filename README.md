# Mini LLM Project
This project, part of **[Code.Sydneyâ€™s](https://www.code.sydney)** AI study group, aims to provide hands-on experience with building and deploying a simple Large Language Model (LLM). The project focuses on using open-source tools to set up a small-scale model, demonstrating core concepts such as data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and deployment.
